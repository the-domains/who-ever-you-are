# I've been thinking about the concept of balance all wrong.

Up until 5 minutes ago, balance has been a one dimensional or two-dimensional theme in my brain, pictured in my mind most often like a scale. I appear in the middle standing still, attempting desperately to keep both sides balanced at all times.

But time doesn't stand still in one place, especially if you consider it in three dimensions, moving forward, backward, up, down, and side to side. Lately I've been thinking about it like a tight rope tied between two massive mountains, stretched loosely over a giant canyon, where if I fell it would mean certain death. As I cross this tight rope, I'm holding a thick silver balancing rod, with suitcases tied on either end, filled with all the aspects of my life. As certain people leave my life, a suitcase pops open dropping the contents below. Then the tension shits and the evenness is corrected for. As I take on extra responsibilities, I lose some of the older suitcases forever as they fall into the ravine.

I lost several suitcases due to getting married and having kids. One of which was filled with dreams I had of living abroad, studying and cooking food in cities around the world. I have to accept forever that I'll never again have the chance to do that.

Imagining balance on all sides --- front, back, bottom, top, side to side and then every iteration in between, requires adjusting accordingly to the unforseen circumstances throwing themselves at you at all times. Birds fly up from the canyon and peck at your face. A strong wind almost blows you off of the rope. Snow freezes your tears as the fear of not making it to the other side temporarily causes both legs to tremble. You squeeze your eyelids to ring out the burning salty sweat squeezed from your pores from the blistering heat, and not being able to see causes missteps that almost lead to your demise.

Life is balance, one way or the other. The trick is that you'll never fall. As events change, the flow of your movement reacts, and you feel pulled one way, the other way, or both ways. Sometimes you just stop walking.

The ravine is there to get you to fear death, even though it's impossible to ever come off the rope. About halfway to the other mountain, you realize that you've been hurrying to get to the other side for the wrong reasons. Counterbalancing against the inevitable obstacles, you've been so focused on not falling, that you never realized the truth.

The Mountain you are slowly inching towards _**is**_ the death you so much fear. You consider turning around, but your feet somehow won't move backwards. Straight ahead is the only way. The closer and closer you get to the mountain, the more and more suitcases fall off as you realize you won't need them when you get there.

Some of us become more and more comfortable with the mountain ahead, and some of us fear each new step.

I used to fear the mountain, but as of late, my strategy has changed.

Instead of freaking out with each new step, I'm dumping off suitcases that I won't need, which makes the balancing act more manageable. And instead of rushing to get to the other side safely, I've just decided to walk more slowly.
